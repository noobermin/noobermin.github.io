    Switch it on, indicators enflame<br/>
    Windows to your soul emit radiance, dazzling<br/>
    To proclaim your inner life! A spirt of motion.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Motion, it diffuses through your casing,<br/>
The air tightens and ebbs to your tremble and pull<br/>
Lifting your animus to these ears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The room is full of the evidence of your being,<br/>
The walls remit your proclamations of life as if<br/>
They lived too as the echos glanced off.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With anticipation, fingers reach and trace the inputs<br/>
A heart minds the heart, the mind hearts the mind,<br/>
Dream deeply of possibilities the others don't understand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Wonder fully of these inner things,<br/>
These braces and identifiers crafted,<br/>
Chosen so choicely by the most intentful choice.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    A child at terminal,<br/>
    Begins her work.<!-- HACK for little square thingy -->
