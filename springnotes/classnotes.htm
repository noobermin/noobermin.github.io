<h1>Class Notes</h1> If you're reading this, I assume you are a student looking for notes from previous classes, as I promised. Here, most of the notes I made for previous classes are posted. In some places, they are a bit terse, which I apologize for. Either way, hopefully this will help you study for the exam. <h2>Spring 2015</h2> <div id="springnotes"><ul> <li><a href="springnotes/week02-demo.pdf">week02-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week03-demo.pdf">week03-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week04-demo.pdf">week04-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week06-demo.pdf">week06-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week07-demo.pdf">week07-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week08-demo.pdf">week08-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week09-demo.pdf">week09-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week10-demo.pdf">week10-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week11-demo.pdf">week11-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week12-demo.pdf">week12-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week13-demo.pdf">week13-demo.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="springnotes/week14-demo.pdf">week14-demo.pdf</a></li> </ul></div>
