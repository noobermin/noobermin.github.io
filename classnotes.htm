<h1>Class Notes</h1>
If you're reading this, I assume you are a student looking for notes from previous classes, as I promised. Here, most of the notes I made for previous classes are posted. In some places, they are a bit terse, which I apologize for. Either way, hopefully this will help you study for the exam.
